# Photiso
An application that helps organize your photos by date taken.

## Why would you want your photos organized this way?

1. Your photos are important! 

Photos organized by date are easier to back up. When you back up a folder from a previous, you probably won't have new photos unless you time travel.

2. Photo programs are great!

Most photo gallery programs let you organize and re-organize your photos independent of how they are stored on disk.  You can organize your photos by date and yet still see all the photos of that time your uncle dropped the birthday cake.

3. Exact duplicates are a pain!

It is easy to make a copy of a photo by double copying off your camera or moving files around.  Photiso detects exact duplicates and puts them out of the way in the duplicates folder. 

## Is Photiso safe?

No promises and you should always have a backup before you start mucking with files. Photiso works hard to either move a file to a location or leave it alone. It never modifies files.

## What are the system requirements?

The latest version is v2.  It should run on any Windows computer with Windows 8 or later.
